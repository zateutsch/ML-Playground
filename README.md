# Welcome to the Playground!
Machine Learning Playground is an open-source educational tool where users can interact with simple ML models. It can be downloaded from the Microsoft store [here.](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PH67Z0FZRJ0)
## How do I use it?
### For Yourself
There's no right or wrong way to use ML Playground, it's designed to let you fiddle with the simplest machine learning models without worrying about the exact nature of the underlying algorithms. To use the app, just pick a model from the catalogue screen and start hitting buttons! 
### For Teaching
The application particularly shines as an educational tool. An instructor can easily set up different scenariors to demonstrate how a model behaves. Adjust paramaters, change data, and alter how the results are visualized. You can use the data sandbox to enter custom data as well.
### Next Steps
Check out [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) if you're ready to dive even deeper.
## Current Features
- Two different ML models to work with: K-Nearest Neighbors and K-Means Clusters
- Multiple real life, publicly available data sets to set up realistic data scenarios.
- Data Sandbox for creation of mock, custom data.
